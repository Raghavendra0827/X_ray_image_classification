# X-ray Image Classification with Transfer Learning

Welcome to the X-ray Image Classification project repository by Raghavendra KN! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

In this repository, Raghavendra KN demonstrates the power of transfer learning and fine-tuning in deep learning by classifying X-ray images.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage a pre-trained model to enhance performance on X-ray image classification.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust the pre-trained model for optimal results on the new dataset.
- **Accurate Classification**: Efficiently classify X-ray images into relevant categories.
- **Resource Efficient**: Save computational resources by reusing and adapting pre-trained models.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <https://github.com/Raghavendra0827/X_ray_image_classification>`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python script to train and evaluate the model on the X-ray image dataset.
4. **Model Inference**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new X-ray images.
